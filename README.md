# editingText

## Description
I have created this text editor app as a PWA so that it can be used on or offline. Because I have built it using webpack.js It can actually be installed to your desk top.
I used Nodejs, Expressjs, Webpackjs and IndexedDB to make this program run.

## Installation
To install this application simply clone the repository and run ``npm install`` to install all the dependancies and dev dependancies needed to run this app. Once this is done then you can run ``npm run start:dev`` 

## Usage
